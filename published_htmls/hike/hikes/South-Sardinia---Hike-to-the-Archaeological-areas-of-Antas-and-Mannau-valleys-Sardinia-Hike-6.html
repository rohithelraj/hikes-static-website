<b>Alternative Start</b>: If temple closed, begin 20m left of fence on trail (uses final return segment).
<br><br>
From the <b>parking lot</b>, a stone-paved path leads to the ticket office. About 30m beside the building, on the way to the temple complex, a path branches left - marked "Villaggio nuragico". After visiting the temple and quarry, we'll continue our way to Grotta su Mannau from here. From the ticket office, it's about 200m to the temple. Set in a picture-book panorama of meadows and green hills stands the proud and mighty <b>Tempio di Antas</b>, named after the Antas Valley. This was said to be home to Sardus Pater, god of the Sardinians. Left of the temple, we find a wooden gate in the fence that surrounds the grounds, and follow signs for <b>Cave romane parco geologico</b><br>
The marked path leads over a terrace with stone walls to a wooded area and a branch, from which we turn left to the quarries. Between the scattered trees, the cut edges of the early stone workings are still clearly visible.<br>
Back it goes on the same way to the temple and to our path shortly before the ticket office. We leave the temple area through a wooden gate and climb a short distance up a meadow path to a settlement of <b>Nuraghi ruins</b>. In the open country, we come to a wide field path, which leads us to a small trail. We discover a narrow path, which leads to the right at a wooden stake in the direction of <b>Grotta su Mannau</b>. It brings us after a few minutes to a small forest path.<br>
We walk along the fence for 1 minute, then turn right following the yellow sign. The path leads to a flat, rocky area where rosemary bushes grow by the trail. The first damaged signpost ("Antica strada romana") is here. We should look closely for traces of the <b>old Roman road</b>. After about 10 minutes, at a trail crossing, we turn left and right, ignoring the two branching paths (Area di Sosta). The trail becomes steep. A ruined wall on the left then limits the path. We turn left and continue steeply upward. The path forks again, and we take the left branch, 2 minutes later arriving at Köhler terraces.<br>
We follow the trail past Köhlerterrassen, then take the left fork towards the Grotta su Mannau. For the return, we take the access road to the Grotta su Mannau, follow the Sandway uphill, and reach the "Sosta Picknick" area after 150m. Turning left and right in the valley, we arrive at an overlook of the Riu Antas in about 35 minutes. From there, we take the steep path up to the Sattel, cross a scree slope, and soon see the Tempio di Antas.<br>
We follow the trail up into the woods, reaching a scenic overlook of the Riu Antas in about 35 minutes. From there, we take a steep, rocky path up to the Sattel. Crossing a scree slope, we arrive at the Punta Su Mannau and can soon see the Tempio di Antas. After about 8 minutes along a narrow path, we leave the main trail and follow a parallel path towards the temple ruins.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Transportation</h3><div>It is a 2 hour 53 minutes drive from our accomodation at Arbatax.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Costs</h3><div>The entrance to the Temple costs 4€.</div></div><div class="sub-images-container title-padding"><h3>Highlights</h3><div class="sub-images-wrapper"><div class="sub-image-item" data-index="0" style="display:block"><div class="sub-image-card"><img src="https://hikes-trailfinder-website-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Sardinia-Hike-6/subImages/image2.webp" alt="Grotta su Mannau"/><h4>Grotta su Mannau</h4><p>The Grotta di Su Mannau is an approximately 8200 meter long one partially developed for tourism stalactite cave in the southwest of the Mediterranean island Sardinia.
