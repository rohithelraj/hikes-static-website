<br>
<br>
<b>1.45 h | 5.7 km | 230m uphill | 230m downhill</b>
<br>
<br>
At the southern tip of the Sinis peninsula, a narrow headland juts out into the Golfo di Oristano: Capo San Marco. Nuragic people had already settled on the leeward side in ancient times, followed by Phoenicians and Romans, who carried out maritime trade from here. They have all left traces behind. Impressive ruins and finds from the ancient port city of Tharros have been preserved and can be viewed. Our hike takes us around the peninsula and along this archaeological site.

<span style="color: #214e09;font-weight:bold">Starting point: car park at the end of S. Giovanni di Sinis, 10 m</span><br>
Coming from Oristano, follow the signs for Cabras/Torre Grande and San Giovanni di Sinis, then turn off to San Giovanni di Sinis just before Capras. Pass the bus parking lot and the parking lot in front of the church until you reach the last possible parking space before the archaeological site. Park opposite two bars. The bus ride from Oristano is only possible in high season <a href="arst.sardegna.it/orari_e_autolinee.html">(arst.sardegna.it/orari_e_autolinee.html)</a>.<br><br>
<span style="color: #214e09;font-weight:bold">Requirements</span><br>
The shadowless route around the cape is mostly on narrow, stony paths, and in the final part on wide sandy paths. Mosquito and sun protection are required in summer. 
<br><br>
<span style="color: #214e09;font-weight:bold">Refreshments</span><br>
In San Giovanni di Sinis there are bars, trattorias and pizzerias.<br><br>

From the car park at the end of San Giovanni di Sinis we walk along the paved footpath for tourists to the entrance of <b>the Tharros archaeological site</b>. On our way back it is worth paying the entrance fee and taking a tour of the ancient site. After a few minutes we walk up a hill to the right to the <b>Torre S. Giovanni</b>. From the top there is a beautiful panoramic view of the <b>Golfo di Oristano</b>.

We walk around the tower, descend the hill and follow the paths over the narrow headland along a long stretch of beach. We take the main path on the left, which runs parallel, on the way back. After 5 minutes, the paths lead into a wide turning loop, bordered by four black bollards and a wire fence. We turn right and take a well-prepared path that leads us first close to the coast, then uphill to the plateau of the cape. Low, wind-bent maquis surrounds us. The path continues to a crossroads on the access road to the <b>lighthouse</b>. We turn left, walk about 100 m and follow a wide, stony path that branches off from the main path to the right down to the leeward coast. It meets a cross path. We keep to the left. The way back is now impossible to miss on the wide gravel path. Below some beautifully situated holiday homes, it leads back to the headland and past the excavation sites back to the starting point.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Transportation</h3><div>We will travel by car around 2 hours 24 minutes from our accomodation at Arbatax.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Equipment</h3><div>Sunscreen, lots of it.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Costs</h3><div>There is an entrance fee at the site of Tharros.</div></div><div class="sub-images-container title-padding"><h3>Highlights</h3><div class="sub-images-wrapper"><div class="sub-image-item" data-index="0" style="display:block"><div class="sub-image-card"><img src="https://hikes-trailfinder-website-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Sardinia-Hike-9/subImages/image2.webp" alt="Tharros"/><h4>Tharros</h4><p>Tharros was established by the Phoenicians around the 8th century BCE as a trading post due to its strategic coastal location. In the 6th century BCE, Tharros came under the control of the Carthaginians. After the Roman conquest in 238 BCE, Tharros flourished as a Roman colony. Around the 9th century CE, Tharros was abandoned due to repeated pirate raids.</p></div></div><div class="sub-image-item" data-index="1" style="display:none"><div class="sub-image-card"><img src="https://hikes-trailfinder-website-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Sardinia-Hike-9/subImages/image3.webp" alt="Church of San Giovanni di Sinis"/><h4>Church of San Giovanni di Sinis</h4><p>A small, paleochristian church dating back to the 5th century AD.
