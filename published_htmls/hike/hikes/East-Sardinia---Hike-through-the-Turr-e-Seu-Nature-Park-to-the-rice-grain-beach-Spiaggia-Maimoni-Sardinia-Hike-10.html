The main attraction of the Sinis peninsula are the beaches of Is Arutas, Mari Ermi and Maimoni. The beaches are mostly made up of small, round ash particles. They are only the size of a grain of rice and glitter in the sun and give your feet a pleasant tingling sensation when you walk on them. One of these beaches at Punta Maimoni is the destination of our hike, during which we cross the Turr 'e Seu Nature Park. The small oasis is a protected area for shore birds, small broad-striped turtles and many dwarf palms, which, protected by dense rockrose growth, can withstand the harsh maritime climate.

From the parking lot in Funtana Meiga

we follow the gravel path that follows the asphalt road straight ahead for about 120 m until we reach a junction where we turn left down to the coast. We reach it after a few minutes. 
We pass a fenced property and reach the entrance to the Turr 'e Seu 2 nature reserve. The park is bordered by a low dry stone wall, the entrance is marked by a small reed-clad fisherman's cottage and the information sign <b>Â»Sinis - Area protected by WWF</b>. Entry is free. We climb up to the old fisherman's cottage, on a wide path slightly uphill. On the left we see ochre-yellow cliffs in which <b>rock pigeons nest</b>. We stay on the wide main path. Tall rockrose bushes surround us. At a fork we turn left and shortly afterwards we are in a small shade.<br>
We have reached <b>a small forest of Aleppo pines</b>. Between the gnarled trunks there is a sheltered picnic area. We leave the forest and turn right at a fork in the road following a red arrow. We pay no attention to the path that turns right shortly afterwards and soon reach the coast. Individual paths lead left over a small dune wall directly to the beach, which does not have any special features here. We initially stay on the wide path. Through the high macchia with rockroses and dwarf palms we reach <b>Punta Maimoni</b>, which is only recognizable by a few flat rocks jutting out into the sea. We keep to the right on a footpath and walk another 500 meters, then we reach <b>the rice grain beach of Spiaggia di Maimoni</b>: a beautiful shallow bay with turquoise water, ideal for a swim. We turn around, walk to Punta Maimoni and from here walk parallel to the way there on a sandy track directly along the beach to <b>the Torre del Sevo o Mosco</b>, which, surrounded by prickly pears, is visible from afar close to the edge of the cliff. We walk around it, stay on the cliff and meander along a trail through the maquis to the main path that we used to enter the nature reserve on the way there. We turn right and walk back to the starting point Funtana Meiga.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Transportation</h3><div>It is a 9 minute drive from Capo San Marco.</div></div><div class="sub-images-container title-padding"><h3>Highlights</h3><div class="sub-images-wrapper"><div class="sub-image-item" data-index="0" style="display:block"><div class="sub-image-card"><img src="https://hikes-trailfinder-website-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Sardinia-Hike-10/subImages/image2.webp" alt="Aleppo Pines"/><h4>Aleppo Pines</h4><p></p></div></div></div><div class="pagination-numbers "><button class="number-btn image-number active" data-index="0">1</button></div></div><div class="related-links title-padding"><h3>Related Links</h3><div class="links"><a href="../../trip/trips/Easter-Trip-to-Sardinia--Trip-2.html" class="link-item">View Trip</a></div></div></div></div></div></div>
