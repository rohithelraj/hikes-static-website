The protected area with its numerous bays, sandy beaches and dune strips is popular with vacationers in southern Sardinia.<br/><br/>
<span style="color: #214e09;font-weight:bold">Starting point: Parking lot at Capo Carbonara viewpoint, 26m</span><br/>
From SS 125 (Cagliari-Muravera), turn off at Villasimius to the right into Via Cagliari, after about 1km turn left into Via Delle Aquile (Porto Turistico area) and after 3km right into Via Degli Oliandri. Follow the signs, past the marina to the end of the street (further access blocked by bollards). Park on the left side.<br/><br/>
<span style="color: #214e09;font-weight:bold">Requirements</span><br/>
Path mostly on narrow trails, sandy paths and rocky plateaus, no shade. Bring swimming gear.<br/><br/>
<span style="color: #214e09;font-weight:bold">Refreshments</span><br/>None along the way. In Villasimius bars and restaurants, accommodations of all types.<br/><br/>

From the parking lot at <b>Capo Carbonara</b>, we briefly walk to the elaborately designed viewpoint plateau with views of the coast and lighthouse on Isola dei Cavoli. An asphalted narrow road runs slightly uphill to the right of the plateau. We follow it. Permitted only for military vehicles, we can climb up into the nature reserve at the cape. After 10 min, the road turns right. We continue straight ahead on a gravel path downhill. Shortly after, we leave the path that curves left and take the narrow trail through the macchia leading straight ahead uphill.
<br/><br/>
We return on the same path, now taking the first narrow path through the macchia down to the coast, reaching<b>Cala Burroni</b>  surrounded by bizarre rock formations. We initially ignore the wide sandy path coming from the left bay. Staying close to the coast, we follow a path on the left side of the bay through wolfsbane growth, passing scenic spots until reaching the sandy path, where we turn right. A few minutes later, another narrow trail marked with cairns branches off to the right and down to the coast. We follow it down to the sandy beach <b>Spiaggia di Cava Usai</b>. Our next destination is the ruins of Torre di Porto Giunco, which we can see from the beach on a hill.
<br/>
We cross the beach, leaving the adjacent park and ruins of an old customs house on the left, and climb up to the former quarry La Cava. Until the 1950s, granite blocks for buildings and paving ships were quarried here. We follow the secured old harbor path briefly and then turn left onto a path leading up the slope, surrounded by tall cacti. At the crossing, we turn right. After returning from the old watchtower, we descend here to the next bay.
<br/>
The path leads up rocky terrain to <b>Torre di Porto Giunco</b> with two openings in the masonry that make the tower appear like an owl. A fantastic view awaits us over the <b>Notteri Lagoon</b>, the long beach separating the lagoon from the sea, and the mountains in the background. Returning to our junction, we go straight ahead following the path to a house ruin on the left side. Shortly before, we follow a path down to <b>Porto Giunco beach</b>. We walk along the beach to a wooden walkway that borders the protected dune area on the Notteri Lagoon side. Flamingos often rest here, dried out in summer due to the heat.<br/>
From the walkway, we follow the lagoon's edge, turn left at the end of the walkway, and after 300m on a meadow path, turn right. We cross the meadow, ignoring the right-leading tracks, and follow a trail up to an area with pines and juniper trees. In gentle curves, the main path leads up to the road, at whose end we reach a small parking area. From this short stretch, we can optionally follow several trails to the left. We reach <b>Via Capo Carbonara</b>, follow it along the road for about 150m to the left, cross it at the turnoff to the Santa Caterina holiday settlement on the right side, and take a meadow path running parallel to the cape access road back to the starting point at the Capo Carbonara parking lot.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Transportation</h3><div>It is a 1 hour 32 minutes drive from our accomodation, to the parking lot at Capo Carbonara.</div></div><div class="info-item title-padding"><h3>Equipment</h3><div>Do not forget your swimwear.</div></div><div class="related-links title-padding"><h3>Related Links</h3><div class="links"><a href="../../trip/trips/Easter-Trip-to-Sardinia--Trip-2.html" class="link-item">View Trip</a></div></div></div></div></div></div>
