  "Description": "Fantastically beautiful porphyry rocks on Sardinia's north coast. \u003cbr\u003e\nOn a short stretch of coast between Isola Rossa and Portobello, east of Castelsardo, Gallura shows itself at its most colorful. Porphyry, wonderfully shaped by the wind, mixes with the turquoise sea and the evergreen maquis to create a unique cocktail of colors. A feast for the eyes! Costa Paradiso - the name couldn't be more appropriate - is the name of this stretch of land that we walk through on this tour. A large holiday home development with the same name is both a place to stop and a point to turn around.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #214e09;font-weight:bold\"\u003eStarting point: hard shoulder at the end of the gravel road at Monte Tinnari, 176 m\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the coastal road SP 90 from Castelsardo in the direction of S. Teresa Gallura, starting from the crossroads, turn left to Isola Rossa, right to Trinit√† d'Agultu, continue straight on for another 2.6 km, about 150 m before the km sign 25 turn left at the large parking lot of the Pizzeria Il Geranio. The gravel road leads right past the pizzeria and a neighboring building. After 1.2 km ignore the turn-off on the left, 900 m further on ignore the turn-off on the left. After another 500 m keep right at a fork in the road. The gravel road ends 200 m further on in front of a white steel gate. About 50 m ahead, Park on the hard shoulder on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #214e09;font-weight:bold\"\u003eRequirements\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMostly clear paths through maquis and cliff landscapes, over sandy and pebble beaches. You will need your hands for a short, steep climbing section at the end of the beach section at Cala Tinnari.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #214e09;font-weight:bold\"\u003eRefreshments\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRestaurant/Bar Costa Paradiso in the holiday complex.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #214e09;font-weight:bold\"\u003eAlternative way back\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the way back you can go up the road on the left at the Stazzo di Porto Leccio and then turn right onto the path through the maquis to Cala Tinnari. This shortcut reduces the walking time by about 15 minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom our parking spot 1 we walk another 50m down the gravel road until it forks. To the left is a private property, to the right through a white iron gate that is always open to the coast, our path. The former road has been furrowed by torrents due to heavy rainfall, but is still ideal for hiking. We follow it steeply downhill. After just 10 minutes the coastal panorama opens up before us. On the right, looking north, the Costa Paradiso holiday home complex can be seen in the shadows. At a fork in the road.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe turn right, now close to the sea. The path narrows, becomes less steep and ends on a small rocky spur, under which, the crescent-shaped bay of Cala Tinnari spreads out. Small rocks are in the sea, the pebble beach shimmers dark grey and black. On the right-hand side you can see a ravine through which the Riu Pirastru makes its way. At its mouth it ends in the small reservoir of the Stagno di Tinnari. We climb down the right-hand side of the rocky spur about 15 m to the beach and cross it to the right to the far end at the steeply sloping cliffs. A wooden sign, about 1 x 1 m in size, attached to two posts slightly raised between the rocks, is our orientation point. About 10 m to the right of it you can see a narrow rocky ravine, on the left-hand side of which we can overcome the small difference in height of 12 m up to the cliffs on narrow steps. We use our hands to help us. Once we reach the top, a footpath takes us up. Alternatively, you can also climb up the slope about 40 m to the right of the stone steps, near a boulder about 1 m high.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA little later, through the maquis, we reach the habitat of a hermit who spends the night here under a shelter during the warm season. A path to the right leads to his dwelling and to the left to his outdoor seating area.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCosta Paradiso is equipped with wooden pallets and curtains closed. We stay on the path and after a few minutes we reach open rocky terrain. Finally we reach the red cliffs, which are particularly beautiful on the left-hand side facing the sea. Narrow water noses push their way into the jagged rocks, popular anchorages for rowing and motor boats in high season. On the clearly trodden path we reach the edge of a small gorge, into which we descend. We walk about 50 m into the gorge until we can't go straight on. On the left-hand edge of the gorge we follow a climb marked with cairns, which ends on a small plateau at a height of about 25 m. Here we leave the well-trodden route and turn left, off the path, down to the sea. The reason: the closer we stay to the sea, the more granite figures and shapes there are to admire. After just 2 minutes we can see a path again, which we can follow to the right. But take a quick look to the left from the cliff edge down to the sea and pause for a moment: At this point the water hits the hollowed-out rocks with a strange, dull rumble. Greetings from Neptune! The path continues up and down through the landscape to a small saddle, behind which the bay of Porto Leccio with the shepherd's house can be seen. We descend a little to a two-lane track that leads us to the Stazzo di Porto Leccio. We leave the 15 m long shepherd's house on the left, cross a road and enter a meadow through the opening in a dry stone wall about 150 cm high. A lance with a large animal skull decorates this entrance. We cross the meadow on a tractor track, open a wooden gate and arrive at the pebble beach of Porto Leccio, which you can descend to on the left in a few steps. We stay on the main path. It forks after we have left the beach and the maquis behind us. To the left, the path continues through the cliffs, to the right, a little further up the slope. Both paths merge again after a few minutes. Again, we stay on the left, close to the coast. It then goes up to a vegetated dune field along the slope of Punta Altina.",
