The beaches are mostly made up of small, round ash particles. They are only the size of a grain of rice and glitter in the sun and give your feet a pleasant tingling sensation when you walk on them. One of these beaches at Punta Maimoni is the destination of our hike, during which we cross the Turr 'e Seu Nature Park. The small oasis is a protected area for shore birds, small broad-striped turtles and many dwarf palms, which, protected by dense rockrose growth, can withstand the harsh maritime climate.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: #214e09;font-weight:bold\"\u003eStarting point: parking lot at the end\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nthe dead end street in the holiday village Funtana Meiga, 8 m. Coming from Oristano or Capras, turn off on the SP 6 towards San Giovanni di Sinis.

We reach it after a few minutes. \nWe pass a fenced property and reach the entrance to the Turr 'e Seu 2 nature reserve. The park is bordered by a low dry stone wall, the entrance is marked by a small reed-clad fisherman's cottage and the information sign \u003cb\u003eÂ»Sinis - Area protected by WWF\u003c/b\u003e. Entry is free. We climb up to the old fisherman's cottage, on a wide path slightly uphill. On the left we see ochre-yellow cliffs in which \u003cb\u003erock pigeons nest\u003c/b\u003e. We stay on the wide main path. Tall rockrose bushes surround us. At a fork we turn left and shortly afterwards we are in a small shade.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have reached \u003cb\u003ea small forest of Aleppo pines\u003c/b\u003e. Between the gnarled trunks there is a sheltered picnic area. We leave the forest and turn right at a fork in the road following a red arrow. We pay no attention to the path that turns right shortly afterwards and soon reach the coast. Individual paths lead left over a small dune wall directly to the beach, which does not have any special features here. We initially stay on the wide path. Through the high macchia with rockroses and dwarf palms we reach \u003cb\u003ePunta Maimoni\u003c/b\u003e, which is only recognizable by a few flat rocks jutting out into the sea. We keep to the right on a footpath and walk another 500 meters, then we reach \u003cb\u003ethe rice grain beach of Spiaggia di Maimoni\u003c/b\u003e: a beautiful shallow bay with turquoise water, ideal for a swim. We turn around, walk to Punta Maimoni and from here walk parallel to the way there on a sandy track directly along the beach to \u003cb\u003ethe Torre del Sevo o Mosco\u003c/b\u003e, which, surrounded by prickly pears, is visible from afar close to the edge of the cliff. We walk around it, stay on the cliff and meander along a trail through the maquis to the main path that we used to enter the nature reserve on the way there. We turn right and walk back to the starting point Funtana Meiga.",
